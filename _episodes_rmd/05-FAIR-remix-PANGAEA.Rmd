We want to analyse ice core data from two different regions of the world (and projects):

- [Arctic (NGRIP) `10.1594/PANGAEA.586886`](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.586886)
- [Antarctic (DomeC) `10.1594/PANGAEA.57629`](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.57629)

Please read both datasets' abstracts now [@northgreenlandicecoreprojectmembers2007ymoo; @lorius1979icrf].

- Noticed the DOIs? Both datasets are **F**indable :-)
  - Even more so, because both are annotated with geographic and event info.
- Noticed the `Download` links over `https`? Easily **a**ccessible data :-)
- [CC-BY-licensed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) means we are
  allowed to **r**euse the material, if we "give appropriate credit, provide a 
  link to the license, and indicate if changes were made." :-) 


However, will the data also be **i**nteroperable and **r**eusable on the technical level? The list of parameters in both cases show that `Age` and `d18O H2O` were measured. Looks good, but will the data integration be that simple (AKA: Will it blend???).

```{r download, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("pangaear")
library(pangaear)
NGRIP <- pg_data(doi = "10.1594/PANGAEA.57629")
DomeC <- pg_data("10.1594/PANGAEA.586886")
```

Before analysing any data, we should get an overview of the R objects we created just now by the downloads:

```{r str1}
str(NGRIP)
```

```{r str2}
str(DomeC)
```

Both lists contain some metadata and the actual `data` as a `tbl_df`. What is that? [Hint: It's from the tidyverse](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).

To verify that both variables `Age` and `d18O H2O` are really labelled in exactly the same way, we extract the variable names of both tibbles and throw out others that exist only in one tibble.


```{r vars}
NGRIP <- NGRIP[[1]]$data
DomeC <- DomeC[[1]]$data
intersect(names(NGRIP), names(DomeC))
# or: c("Age [ka BP]", "d18O H2O [per mil SMOW]") %in% c(names(NGRIP), names(DomeC))
```

This is great, because we get only exactly two variable names. If there had been even the slightest difference in the name, unit, or a spelling mistake, we would have seen less output, because the `names` wouldn't have `intersect`-ed.

We can now plot both datasets' `d18O H2O` values against the same `Age` axis. Because the variables names contain spaces and brackets, we have to use the "back tick" character (`` ` ``) around both. `Snake_case` colum names would have saved us from this, but hey!

```{r plot}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = NGRIP,
       mapping = aes(x = `Age [ka BP]`, y = `d18O H2O [per mil SMOW]`)) +
  geom_point(color = "dark green") + # inherits data & mapping from above
  geom_point(data = DomeC # overwrites above data, but inherits x & y
             ) +
  scale_x_reverse() # because Age means the past
```

Incidentally, the `Dome C` core (black, east Antarctica) captured higher `d18O` concentrations, than `NGRIP` (*Green*land).

Integrating the two datasets with this little code was possible, only because both variables were named exactly the same and thus easily machine-readable. If they hadn't been, we would have needed to:

a) either rename one between downloading and plotting, or

```{r str_diff, eval=FALSE}
names(NGRIP$`some other Age variable's name`) <- names(DomeC$Age_ka_BP)
names(NGRIP$`some other d18O variable's name`) <- names(DomeC$d18O_H2O_per_mil_SMOW)
```

b) specify in `geom_point` which second `y` should be plotted.

```{r plot2, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = DomeC,
       mapping = aes(x = `Age [ka BP]`, y = `d18O H2O [per mil SMOW]`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = NGRIP,
             mapping = aes(x = `some other Age variable's name`,
                           y = `some other d18O variable's name`)
             color = "dark green")
```

So, this seemed pretty FAIR, right? Granted, **i**nteroperability encompasses a [few qualities](https://blogs.tib.eu/wp/tib/2017/09/12/the-fair-data-principles-for-research-data/#i) besides uniform variable names. However, the datasets were well **f**indable & **a**ccessible, community-standard variable naming and the [CC BY 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) mean good **r**eusability.

This is the power of FAIR combined with nicely packaged-up R code: Reducing the burden of finding, downloading and cleaning up datasets.
